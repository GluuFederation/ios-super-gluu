## Helpers

Initialize View Controllers Easier

`let viewController = LandingViewController.fromStoryboard("Authentication")`

Initialize View

`let loadingView: LoadingView = .fromNib()`

Show Error Message

`SwiftMessages.show(.error, message: loginValidationError)`

Display Alert/Error Messages 

Use `SwiftMessages+ApartmentButler`

Use ObjectMapper, PromiseKit, and Alamofire together.

```
Alamofire.request(AuthorizationRouter.signIn(user)).responseModel(AuthenticationResponse.self).then { loginResponse -> Void in

  // Handle the model response here
  
}.always {

  // Remove loading here
  
}.catch { error in

  // Handle errors here
  
}
```


## Styles
