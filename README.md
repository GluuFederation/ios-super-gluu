# Super Gluu iOS
Super Gluu is a push-notification mobile app for two-factor authentication (2FA).

Super Gluu is tightly bundled with the [Gluu Server](https://gluu.org/docs/ce) identity and access management platform, and can be used to achieve 2FA for web and mobile applications that leverage Gluu for authentication.
